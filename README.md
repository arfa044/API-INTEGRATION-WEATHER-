DESCRIPTION ON WEATHER APP

In this project, we’ll be building a simple and clean Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create a user-friendly weather website where users can search for any city and instantly get the current weather information for that location.

We’ll be using a free API key from OpenWeatherMap, which gives us access to real-time weather data. Once a city name is entered in the search box, our app will fetch data like temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed, and display it on the screen. This is a great way to understand how APIs work and how to display live data using JavaScript.

The app is completely frontend-based, so there’s no backend or server required. It's perfect for beginners who want to learn about API integration and dynamic content updates with JavaScript. The UI is built using HTML and styled with CSS to make it visually clean and easy to use. The weather data is pulled using JavaScript's fetch() method, and the response is handled to extract only the necessary information.

One of the main features of this app is the search box. Users can type in the name of any city around the world, hit Enter, and get live weather details for that city. This includes the current temperature in Celsius, the weather condition (like cloudy, sunny, etc.), humidity in percentage, and the wind speed in km/h.

The goal of this project is not just to show weather, but to give learners a hands-on example of how real-world applications work. It’s a practical way to see how frontend code connects with an external API, how to handle that data, and how to update the webpage dynamically without reloading. It’s also an opportunity to explore things like responsive layout, icons, fonts, and visual presentation.

To use this project, you’ll need to sign up on OpenWeatherMap and get a free API key. That key will be used in your JavaScript code to request the weather data. If you're planning to upload this project to GitHub, make sure to hide your API key using a .env file (if using a backend) or avoid pushing your key directly to public repositories for security.

Overall, this weather app is a great mini-project that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs. Whether you're a student, beginner, or just trying to build your portfolio, this project will help you practice working with live data, improve your UI skills, and understand how real-time applications are built on the web.
